**Basic Questions:**

1. **What is React?**
   - React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It enables the creation of reusable UI components, enhancing development efficiency.

2. **What are the main features of React?**
   - **JSX:** A syntax extension that allows writing HTML structures within JavaScript code.
   - **Components:** Reusable UI elements that can be nested and managed independently.
   - **Virtual DOM:** A lightweight representation of the real DOM that improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
   - **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows in a single direction, making the application more predictable and easier to debug.

3. **Explain the concept of Virtual DOM.**
   - The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. React uses it to optimize UI updates by comparing the current state with the previous one and updating only the necessary parts of the real DOM, leading to improved performance.

4. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It simplifies the creation of React elements and components.

5. **How does React differ from other JavaScript frameworks?**
   - React focuses on building UI components and relies on a unidirectional data flow. Unlike frameworks like Angular, React is more of a library that can be integrated with other libraries or frameworks, offering greater flexibility.

6. **What are components in React?**
   - Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are self-contained units that manage their own state and render UI elements. Components can be either class-based or functional.

7. **Differentiate between functional and class components.**
   - **Class Components:** ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and can hold local state and lifecycle methods.
   - **Functional Components:** Simpler components defined as functions. With the introduction of hooks, they can now manage state and side effects.

8. **What are props in React?**
   - Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow down the component tree and are immutable within the receiving component.

9. **How is state managed in React?**
   - State is managed within components and represents data that can change over time. In class components, state is managed using `this.state` and updated with `this.setState()`. In functional components, the `useState` hook is used to manage state.

10. **What is the purpose of the `render()` method in React?**
    - The `render()` method is responsible for describing the UI of a component. It returns the JSX that defines what the component should display.

**Intermediate Questions:**

11. **What are React lifecycle methods?**
    - Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that allow developers to run code at specific points in a component's life, such as when it mounts, updates, or unmounts. Examples include `componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

12. **Explain the use of hooks in React.**
    - Hooks are functions that let developers use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects.

13. **What is the Context API?**
    - The Context API is a feature that allows developers to share values (like themes or user information) between components without having to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree.

14. **How does React handle events?**
    - React handles events using camelCase syntax and passes event handlers as functions. For example, `onClick` is used instead of `onclick`.

15. **What are higher-order components (HOC)?**
    - HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They are used to reuse component logic.

16. **Explain the concept of prop drilling and how to avoid it.**
    - Prop drilling occurs when props are passed through multiple layers of components to reach a deeply nested component. This can be avoided by using the Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

17. **What are controlled and uncontrolled components?**
    - **Controlled Components:** Components where form data is handled by the state within the component.
    - **Uncontrolled Components:** Components where form data is handled by the DOM itself, and refs are used to access the form values.

18. **How do you optimize performance in a React application?**
    - Performance can be optimized by:
      - Using the Virtual DOM efficiently.
      - Implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
      - Code-splitting to load only necessary code.
      - Lazy loading components and images.

19. **What is React Router, and how does it work?**
    - React Router is a library that enables navigation among views in a React application. It allows developers to define routes and map them to components, enabling single-page application behavior.

20. **How do you handle forms in React?**
    - Forms in React can be handled by:
      - Using controlled components, where form data is managed by the component's state.
      - Using uncontrolled components, where form data is managed by the DOM.

**Advanced Questions:**

21. **What is Redux, and how does it integrate with React?**
    - Redux is a state management library that provides a centralized store for the application's state. It integrates with React by connecting components to the store, allowing for predictable state transitions.

22. **Explain the concept of server-side rendering in React.**
    - Server-side rendering (SSR) involves rendering React components on the server and sending the fully rendered page to the client. This improves initial load time and SEO performance.

23. **What are error boundaries in React?**
    - Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the component tree.

24. **How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?**
    - React's reconciliation algorithm, known as "diffing," compares the current Virtual DOM with a previous snapshot and updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, optimizing performance.

25. **What is the significance of keys in React lists?**
    - In React, keys are unique identifiers assigned to elements in a list to help React efficiently manage and update the user interface. They enable React to identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, allowing for optimal rendering performance.

**26. How do you implement code splitting in a React application?**

   - Code splitting is a technique to split your code into smaller bundles, which can be loaded on demand. In React, this can be achieved using dynamic `import()` statements and React's `Suspense` component to load components lazily.

**27. What are React portals?**

   - React portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the parent component. This is useful for modals, tooltips, and other UI elements that need to break out of their parent container's styling constraints.

**28. Explain the use of the `useEffect` hook.**

   - The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It combines the behavior of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` from class components.

**29. How do you manage side effects in React?**

   - Side effects in React are managed using the `useEffect` hook in functional components and lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.

**30. What are the differences between React and React Native?**

   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications, while React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications using React. React Native allows you to write mobile applications using JavaScript and React, which are then rendered using native components.

**31. How do you test React components?**

   - React components can be tested using tools like Jest for running tests and React Testing Library for rendering components and interacting with them in a way that simulates user behavior.

**32. What is the purpose of PropTypes in React?**

   - PropTypes are used to validate the props passed to a component, ensuring that they are of the correct type and meet the specified requirements. This helps in catching bugs and improving code readability.

**33. How do you handle state management in large React applications?**

   - In large applications, state management can be handled using libraries like Redux or the Context API. Redux provides a centralized store for the application's state, while the Context API allows for sharing state across components without prop drilling.

**34. What are some best practices for structuring React applications?**

   - Best practices include organizing components into a logical directory structure, keeping components small and focused, using functional components with hooks, and managing state appropriately.

**35. How do you ensure accessibility in React applications?**

   - Ensuring accessibility involves using semantic HTML elements, providing alternative text for images, ensuring proper keyboard navigation, and using ARIA attributes where necessary. Tools like ESLint plugins and accessibility audits can help identify and fix accessibility issues.
